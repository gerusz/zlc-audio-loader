# zlc-audio-loader
Just a little GreaseMonkey script to load the audio files properly on ZombieLink classic. Will be obsolete once they bring the playback features to the new ZL or fix the classic.

How to use / install with Tampermonkey (I haven't used Greasemonkey in a while... or Firefox, for that matter, sorry):

1. Click on "Download Zip" (should be at the bottom of the right column)
2. Open the Tampermonkey dashboard (click on the Tampermonkey icon, click on "Dashboard")
3. Click on the "Utilities" tab
4. In the "Zip" row click on the "Choose file" button, select the zip you downloaded from Github
5. Click on "Import"
6. That's it. If you visit http://classic.zombiesrungame.com, log in and click on "Missions", you can listen to the radio segments.

You'll obviously need [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en-us) for Chrome.
